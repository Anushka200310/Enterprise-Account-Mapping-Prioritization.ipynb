# Enterprise-Account-Mapping-Prioritization.ipynb
 
### Business Development Analytics Project

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a **data-driven approach to enterprise account mapping** 
The goal is to help Business Development teams **identify, score, and prioritize enterprise organizations** that are most likely to benefit from leadership readiness and succession solutions.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
- Reduce inefficient, broad-based enterprise outreach  
- Prioritize accounts with **high leadership complexity and succession risk**  
- Support focused CXO-level sales and partnership strategies  

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Enterprise sales cycles are long and resource-intensive.  
Not all large organizations have equal urgency for leadership development platforms.

This project addresses that challenge by introducing a **weighted scoring model** that ranks enterprises based on business relevance rather than size alone.

## 🛠️ Approach & Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
Simulated enterprise-level data was created with the following parameters:
- Industry
- Employee count
- Leadership complexity (scale 1–5)
- Succession risk (scale 1–5)

### 2. Feature Normalization
- Employee count is normalized to ensure fair comparison across organizations.

### 3. Scoring Model
A weighted score is calculated using:
- Leadership Complexity – 40%
- Succession Risk – 40%
- Organization Size (Employee Count) – 20%

### 4. Account Prioritization
Based on the total score, organizations are classified into:
- **High Priority**
- **Medium Priority**
- **Low Priority**

---

## 📊 Output
The final output is a **ranked enterprise target account list** that enables:
- Immediate outreach to high-priority accounts
- Nurture campaigns for medium-priority accounts
- Long-term tracking for low-priority accounts

---

## 📈 Business Impact
- Improves focus and efficiency of Business Development teams  
- Aligns product value with enterprise leadership challenges  
- Enables scalable, repeatable account prioritization  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Integration with real CRM and LinkedIn data  
- Industry-specific pitch recommendations  
- Visualization dashboards for BD teams  
- Automated quarterly score updates
